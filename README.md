# TeaSteeper
A simple progressive web application by Brian Turner
## Overview
The UI of the Tea Steeper is quite simple, using a simplistic black/white design.
The user can start using the appication by simply specificying which tea they 
would like to steep. Once a tea is selected, a timer begins and a tea cup appears. 
The cup begins to fill up as time goes on. During this time a 'CANCEL' button will
appear and give the user the ability to cancel the timer, and return to the home page.
